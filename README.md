# A starter for laravel and Vuex with vue router
It is a very simple starter kit for laravel to start your project using vuex and vue router. Once you clonned this project and installed all dependencies through composer and npm, run the project and you will see the home page with 3 navigation links. Each link is routed through vue router and the main heading is coming through the vuex store which calls very simple laravel API written in api.php
